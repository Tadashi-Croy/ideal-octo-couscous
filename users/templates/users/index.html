            <p>My Dog and Training Buddy:</p>

            <p> I own one dog named <strong>Lana</strong>. She is one of the friendliest and well behaved dogs I have ever had the pleasure of owning, 
                but she didn't start out that way.
                She was originally abandoned after she was bred out and abandoned once again by her first adoptive family for 
                destructive behavior and aggressiveness towards cats. <br>
                Now she has become not only a family member but a valued member of my training team. She has been frequently used by rescues and personal clients
                in socializing and is an pristine example of what training can accomplish.

                    <br> <br>
                    I have been working professionally with dogs since 2017 and spend a lot of time 
                    volunteering with local animal rescues and shelters. I have fostered dogs in the past, 
                    but since having a baby, my focus has been helping foster parents with free one on one 
                    training, group classes, learning materials, pack walks, and overnight stays. There is always 
                    more to learn from rescue dogs and nothing is more rewarding than seeing them grow into the 
                    confident, happy dogs they deserve to be! I graduated from CATCH Canine Trainers Academy in 2020. 
                    I became a CPDT-KA certified trainer in 2021, fear-free certified in 2021, and am a member of the 
                    Association of Professional Dog Trainers.

                    <br> <br>
                    Positive reinforcement/training philosophy
                    The science behind dog behavior and training has come a long way over the years and now has 
                    proven the effectiveness of positive reinforcement over punishment. Teaching a dog what to do 
                    and rewarding them is more effective than simply punishing them for doing something wrong. They 
                    need to clearly know what we want them to do, and they need to want to do it. Punishment and 
                    corrections increase stress on our dogs and hurts our relationship with them. On the other hand, 
                    positive reinforcement methods make learning exciting, good behavior fun, and builds a stronger bond. 
                    Training should be enjoyable for everyone involved!
                    I believe in looking at each dog as a whole individual. They all are motivated by 
                    different rewards and have different mental and physical needs. By fulfilling all a dogâ€™s needs
                    and building up confidence, they are not only happier and healthier, but ready to listen and learn!
