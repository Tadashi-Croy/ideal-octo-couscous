        <p class="top-about-me">
            I have been working professionally with dogs since 2017 and spend a lot of time 
            volunteering with local animal rescues and shelters. I have fostered dogs in the past, 
            but since having a baby, my focus has been helping foster parents with free one on one 
            training, group classes, learning materials, pack walks, and overnight stays. There is always 
            more to learn from rescue dogs and nothing is more rewarding than seeing them grow into the 
            confident, happy dogs they deserve to be! I graduated from CATCH Canine Trainers Academy in 2020. 
            I became a CPDT-KA certified trainer in 2021, fear-free certified in 2021, and am a member of the 
            Association of Professional Dog Trainers.

            Positive reinforcement/training philosophy
            The science behind dog behavior and training has come a long way over the years and now has 
            proven the effectiveness of positive reinforcement over punishment. Teaching a dog what to do 
            and rewarding them is more effective than simply punishing them for doing something wrong. They 
            need to clearly know what we want them to do, and they need to want to do it. Punishment and 
            corrections increase stress on our dogs and hurts our relationship with them. On the other hand, 
            positive reinforcement methods make learning exciting, good behavior fun, and builds a stronger bond. 
            Training should be enjoyable for everyone involved!
            I believe in looking at each dog as a whole individual. They all are motivated by 
            different rewards and have different mental and physical needs. By fulfilling all a dogâ€™s needs
            and building up confidence, they are not only happier and healthier, but ready to listen and learn!
