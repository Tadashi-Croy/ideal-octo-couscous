                        How to get attentive, enthusiastic responses from your pup in training exercises and everyday life:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ol>

                            &ThickSpace;
                                Build your relationship with your puppy through fun, structured play, and training sessions.  If you and your pup enjoy learning 
                                and exploring new things together every day, you will see amazing results in your training. 
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                Exercise, mental stimulation, and socialization are keys to raising a happy, well-behaved puppy.  Regular play and new 
                                experiences should be a part of every pup’s routine.  Under-stimulated dogs get into a lot more trouble and can’t seem to relax.
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                Practice training once or twice a day for 5-15 minutes each session.  Make this your average.  If you prefer more, go for it!  
                                Integrating training exercises into your everyday activities will make a big difference (see #5 below for examples of this).
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                Practice in different environments.  Start with success in a non-distracting place (e.g., a quiet bedroom) and gradually 
                                work your way up to more challenging situations (e.g., the park).
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                Vary your rewards.  Dogs get bored just like we do.  Use a variety of toys, touch, praise, food and real-life rewards.  
                                For example, request that your pup Sit before you: play a game with a toy, open a door for her, invite her into your lap for 
                                petting, deliver a meal, give her attention when you come home, or let her out of the crate/pen.
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                Be consistent with your cues and rules.  Request behaviors with the exact same verbal cue or hand signal every time.  
                                Also, don’t allow a behavior sometimes and then get upset with your puppy for doing it at other times 
                                (e.g., jumping or begging at the table).
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                Manage your puppy’s environment to set him up for success and don’t give him opportunities to get into trouble.  
                                Then you will catch him doing good things you can reward him for.
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                Timing is everything.  Let your pup know if you like or dislike a behavior WHILE it is happening.  
                                Two seconds after is too late.
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            &ThickSpace;
                                If you “correct” your pup, then redirect your pup.  If you interrupt or distract your puppy from something she is doing wrong,
                                give her something else to do that is right (and make the right behavior more fun!).
                            
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                             &ThickSpace;
                                Master “green light” and “red light” communication.  Always communicate clearly with your voice, body language, 
                                and facial expression whether you are sending the fundamental message of “yes” or “no” to your pup.   For example, an 
                                effective “Come” command should be an inviting signal with a “green light/yes” tone (happy, bright, high-pitched) 
                                whereas “Stop That” would be more effective as a stern signal with a “red light/no” tone (deeper pitched, perhaps louder 
                                or more abrupt depending on dog).  How your communication is interpreted depends on the personality of the dog.  
                                Talk to your trainer about how to get the most out of your relationship with YOUR dog.

                        Six Rules That Lead To Success

                                &ThickSpace;Your pup should always be supervised or confined.  Supervise your pup closely or have him in the crate 
                                (or pen if you are using wee-wee pads). Supervised means if your pup has an accident, you will see it taking place.  
                                The only exception to this rule is if you know your pup has just “done all of his business” and now has an “empty tank.”  
                                Then, you may be able to get away with a brief period of less intense supervision, but never no supervision.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ThickSpace;Take your pup to the right place as often as he needs to go.  Learn your pup’s patterns and set up your routine 
                                accordingly.  Watch for sniffing, whining, circling, panting, or suddenly wandering away from you.  These are signs that he 
                                needs to “go.”  Take him to his place to go!  Also, take him after he: chews heavily on a toy, plays hard, or wakes from a nap.

                            </li>

                                &ThickSpace;Give your pup a treat *immediately* after he “goes” in the right place.  The right place is going to be outside or 
                                the wee-wee pad, depending on what you are training for at any particular time.  Choose one high-value food treat that you will 
                                only use for going to the bathroom in the right place.  This makes it more memorable.  Hint: If you are using wee-wee pads, and 
                                you eventually want your pup to “go” outside only – do not offer a food reward for going on the pads.  Save that for outside.  
                                For now, offer lots of verbal praise instead.  

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ThickSpace;If you catch your puppy “going” in the wrong place, interrupt him with “eh! eh!” or one sharp clap, then:
                                <br>

                                &divideontimes; If you think he will relieve himself further, immediately take him outside or to the wee-wee pad.  If/when he finishes in the right 
                                    place, praise him warmly and give him that special food treat.
                                <br>
                                &divideontimes;If you think he has already relieved himself enough that he is not going to “finish” outside or on the wee-wee pad (this is the most
                                    likely scenario), then be sure to confine him immediately after you catch him in the act.  This is so that he does not run over 
                                    to play with your towel while you clean up the mess.
                                <br>  
                                <strong>Remember, when you catch him in the act, DO NOT yell harshly – you only need to interrupt the unwanted behavior – you never want to frighten
                                     your pup to the point where he thinks he should hide from you.</strong>

                        Play is the key to good manners and a strong bond: In addition to the obvious benefits of mental and 
                        physical exercise, play between you and your pup is the secret to developing a great relationship.  
                        This great relationship is the key to a well-mannered dog who wants to listen to her owner.  Play is also
                         an ideal way to teach your dog to understand communication and rules.  In this lesson, we will learn how 
                         to teach easy games that are great for playing with your dog: stalk/chase the toy, tug, and fetch (retrieve). 
                    </p>


                

                    <div class="play-games">
                        <p class="game" > <strong>
                            Stalk/Chase Game:
                            </strong>
                            <br>
                            
                            This is a great way to get your pup interested in grabbing and holding a toy.  
                            Try moving a toy around on the floor at varying speeds, towards him, then away.   Making toys act 
                            like animal prey will incite your pup’s natural instinct to want to chase and grab them.  You can 
                            also show your pup a toy, let him smell or look at it for a second, then snatch it away as soon as 
                            he wants it, acting like it is the greatest possession you’ve ever found.  It may sound like teasing, 
                            but it’s just a game to teach your pup that toys are fun.  When you appear to value something greatly, 
                            your pup will want it too!  Hint: Squeakers don’t hurt, either.  
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="game">
                            <strong>
                            Tug:
                            </strong>
                            <br>

                            Once your dog starts grabbing at a toy, starting a game of tug is easy – just gently pull the 
                            toy and your pup is likely to pull back!  Soft toys are best for this.  Below we will teach you how to
                            play tug with rules so that your dog learns how to control their biting and jumping, and “say please” 
                            in order to continue the game.  The games we teach are super-fun and great for releasing energy, but 
                            they must also teach communication and rules.  For example, never allow your pup to grab your hands or 
                            clothing.  Whenever he does this, immediately fold your arms and turn away from the game as if you are 
                            completely turned off.  For an instant, your pup will be surprised, stop mouthing you, and look up as 
                            if to say, “What did I do?” In that instant, you can praise and re-engage the game.  

                            If your pup continues to play too aggressively, consider that he may need a time-out until he can cool 
                            down or he may need more exercise outlets in general.  Praise your pup lavishly when he grabs toys 
                            instead of you, and make the toys the most fun thing to grab by instigating games of chase, tug, and 
                            fetch.  For more help dealing with a “mouthy” puppy, ask your Trainer.

                                    Retrieve often works best after you have established the first 2 games of stalk/chase and tug.

                                    Choose a toy that your puppy likes, but it shouldn’t be so exciting that she just wants to 
                                    keeps it to herself.  She should think that the toy is more fun when you play with it, too!

                                    Get her really excited about the toy, then toss it a few feet away.  When she grabs it, praise 
                                    and entice her to come back to you by making fun sounds such as kisses or a drum roll on the floor. 
                                    Hint: Gently pulling on a leash often helps to get a puppy coming in your direction.

                                    If your pup comes to you without the toy, praise lavishly anyway.  Then, grab the toy yourself 
                                    and repeat step 4, more enthusiastically.

                                    When your pup brings toys to you, don’t grab for the toy right away; instead, praise and touch 
                                    her in a way she loves.  This will make her want to keep “sharing” toys with you and bring them to 
                                    you as a “safe” place to enjoy them, rather than run away from you with them.

                                    Once your pup is comfortable bringing toys back to you, reward her not only with praise, but by 
                                    immediately engaging in more play!
